# Fruit search Project

This web application provides the user with a search bar and a pre-populated list of different fruits. Depending on what the user types, a suggeted list of fruits are shown where the fruit names contain the letter(s) the user has typed. The user can click on a fruit from the suggested list and the search bar is populated with it.
